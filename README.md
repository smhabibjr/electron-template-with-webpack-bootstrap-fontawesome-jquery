Hint: On WSL, you may encountered a futex utility error. In that case, what works for me was installing electron specifically from the PowerShell command line tool like so:


Head to your project directory from the PowerShell command line tool cd path/to/your/repo, 
and Run 

````
npm install --save-dev electron
````

Go back to the WSL command line running Ubuntu and run again yarn start.
